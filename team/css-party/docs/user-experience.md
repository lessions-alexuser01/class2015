User Experience
====

- when someone visits the homepage they are seeing "view mode". All updates are seen but no option to make any change.
- if you have a key you can go to `edit/:key` to access "edit mode". This looks the same as view mode but changes to your elements are saved and broadcast to everyone else.


Registering a new user
====

- to register someone we just need their email address.
- a unique secret key is assigned to them and stored along with their details.
- 10 divs are created and initialized with the default (randomly generated) styles.
